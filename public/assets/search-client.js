Christians must call abortion what it is\u2014murder\u2014and call people to repentance and faith in Christ, who alone can forgive sin and change hearts (1 John 1:9).",

Pro-life legislation usually allows abortion in some cases or only prior to certain stages of development. Abolition rejects partial measures and demands equal justice for all preborn children (Proverbs 17:15; Isaiah 1:16\u201317). Scripture teaches that murder should not be regulated but punished (Romans 13:3\u20134). Abolition stands on that truth.

    content: "We answer that claim by going back to the truth about what abortion is . Scripture and reason both reveal that abortion is the intentional killing of an innocent human being . No act that deliberately takes innocent human life can rightly be called \u201Chealthcare.\u201D Healthcare, properly defined, is the practice of preserving and restoring health . It aims to protect life, heal the sick, and care for the weak. Abortion, by contrast, ends the life of one human being and often harms the body and soul of another. To call it \u201Chealthcare\u201D is to corrupt language in order to justify evil\u2014much like calling slavery \u201Cproperty management\u201D or genocide \u201Cpopulation control.\u201D It is a lie that disguises murder as mercy (Isaiah 5:20). From a biblical standpoint: - God alone has the authority to give and take life (Deuteronomy 32:39). - He commands, \u201CYou shall not murder\u201D (Exodus 20:13). - The civil magistrate\u2019s duty is to protect the innocent, not authorize their destruction (Romans 13:3\u20134). Thus, abortion is not medicine; it is rebellion against the Creator and injustice against one\u2019s smallest neighbor. Real healthcare would treat both the mother and the child as patients worthy of protection and care. It would seek to preserve both lives, not pit them against each other. As abolitionists, we must also expose how the \u201Chealthcare\u201D claim functions strategically\u2014it reframes moral evil as medical necessity to numb consciences and legalize murder. Christians must reject that framing entirely, not debate it on its own terms. The issue is not about access to medical services; it is about obedience to God\u2019s law and justice for the innocent .",

    content: "That question goes right to the heart of the matter, and it\u2019s one that deserves a clear and biblical answer. First, even if every aborted child were immediately received into the presence of Christ\u2014which many Reformed Baptists and other Protestants believe is indeed the case\u2014that would not make abortion any less evil. Scripture is clear that we are never permitted to do evil that good may come (Romans 3:8). The fact that God can redeem evil actions and bring good from them does not justify committing those actions. God\u2019s sovereignty never excuses man\u2019s sin. Abortion is murder\u2014the intentional killing of an innocent human being. Each child in the womb is a living soul made by God (Psalm 139:13\u201316; Jeremiah 1:5). The moral question, therefore, is not what happens to the baby afterward , but what man has done before God in shedding innocent blood. We might also ask: would it be righteous for us to kill all infants, or all Christians, because we believe they would go to Heaven? Of course not. That would be rebellion against God\u2019s law. Abortion is not a mercy; it is the unjust destruction of a neighbor whom we are commanded to love (Matthew 22:39). In addition, God uses even the short lives of those little ones to testify to His justice and grace. Their deaths are not meaningless, but their murderers will be held accountable unless they repent and trust in Christ. God commands rulers to protect innocent life, not to destroy it (Romans 13:3\u20134). The abolitionist stance is simply obedience to that command\u2014calling both individuals and nations to repent immediately and abolish abortion entirely , not regulate or excuse it.",

Job says, "why did I not die at birth?", indicating he was alive in the womb before he was born. Additionally, in the Gospel of Luke, we read that when Mary visited Elizabeth, the unborn John the Baptist leaped in her womb upon hearing Mary's greeting (Luke 1:41). These passages indicate that life--and personhood--are present even while in the womb. Scientific Answer: According to the position paper by the American College of Pediatricians titled <a href="https://acpeds.org/when-human-life-begins/" target=" blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" When Human Life Begins </a , "research in embryology and related biological sciences overwhelmingly indicates that human life begins at conception (fertilization)." At fertilization the zygote is a living, genetically distinct human organism who will grow and develop through every subsequent stage of life.`,

Although God's grace is sufficient to forgive any sin His people commit or have committed Scripture repeatedly warns us to never presume upon that grace (Romans 6:1-2). We should not sin with the expectation of forgiveness (Romans 3:8). If you find yourself thinking that way, it is a sign you have not yet bowed your knee to Christ as Lord; you likely do not have eternal life abiding in you (1 John 2:3-4)! In fact, Scripture warns that presumption and arrogance amount to idolatry (1 Samuel 15:22-23). When you assume God will forgive a sin you knowingly engage in, you are believing in a false god who cannot save you (Exodus 20:3; Galatians 6:7-8). The Bible commands us to flee sinful passions and trust that what God has said is true: righteous choices are always what is best for ourselves and others (Titus 2:11-12; Psalm 19:7-11).",
