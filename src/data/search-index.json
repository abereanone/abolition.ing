    "content": "Abortion is wrong because it is the taking of innocent human life. God commands, “You shall not murder” (Exodus 20:13). A child in the womb is a living human being from conception (Psalm 139:13–16; Luke 1:41). Ending that life is a direct violation of God’s law. Abortion is not healthcare; it is violence against the most defenseless among us. God hates hands that shed innocent blood (Proverbs 6:16–17). Christians must call abortion what it is—murder—and call people to repentance and faith in Christ, who alone can forgive sin and change hearts (1 John 1:9)."

There is a difference between preventing conception and taking a life that has already begun. Couples must act with knowledge and care, honoring God in every decision (Romans 14:12). The motive behind using birth control also matters. If the goal is selfishness or fear, that motive is sinful (Psalm 127:3–5). Each couple should seek the Lord in prayer and act with a clear conscience, trusting His wisdom."

Pro-life legislation usually allows abortion in some cases or only prior to certain stages of development. Abolition rejects partial measures and demands equal justice for all preborn children (Proverbs 17:15; Isaiah 1:16–17). Scripture teaches that murder should not be regulated but punished (Romans 13:3–4). Abolition stands on that truth. The goal is not fewer abortions—it is no abortions, because every life is to be protected according to God."

Abortion is never necessary, but it may be necessary to remove the child from the fallopian tubes, and this is not the same as intentional abortion. When doctors act to save the mother’s life, and the child’s death is an unintended result, this is not the same as abortion. The moral difference is the purpose. Abortion intends to kill; treatment in an ectopic case seeks to preserve life where possible (Exodus 21:22–23). Christians should approach such cases with prayer, wisdom, and compassion, trusting God’s mercy even in sorrow. Maybe if we are faithful to God in our efforts to save childre, He will one day bless us with wisdom and technology to save babies in ectopic pregnancies!"

Abortion is the taking of an innocent life, and that reality must be spoken plainly (Exodus 20:13; Proverbs 28:13). Yet we must also proclaim the power of God’s grace. Forgiveness is real and complete for all who repent and trust in Jesus Christ (1 John 1:9; Isaiah 1:18). Healing does not come by downplaying sin but by confessing it and finding mercy in the Savior who bore our guilt. The church’s role is to speak the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15), walking beside post-abortive women with compassion and hope. Through the gospel, shame is replaced with peace, and broken lives are made new in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17)."

An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a human embryo implants outside the uterus—most often in a fallopian tube—where it cannot survive and where rupture endangers the mother’s life.

They should first assess needs within the church, mobilize members to help with meals, childcare, and mentorship, manage a deacon’s fund for emergency aid, and pair every act of mercy with discipleship and pastoral care. In all, they reflect Christ’s compassion and uphold His righteousness in service to vulnerable families."

    "content": "We answer that claim by going back to the truth about what abortion is . Scripture and reason both reveal that abortion is the intentional killing of an innocent human being . No act that deliberately takes innocent human life can rightly be called “healthcare.” Healthcare, properly defined, is the practice of preserving and restoring health . It aims to protect life, heal the sick, and care for the weak. Abortion, by contrast, ends the life of one human being and often harms the body and soul of another. To call it “healthcare” is to corrupt language in order to justify evil—much like calling slavery “property management” or genocide “population control.” It is a lie that disguises murder as mercy (Isaiah 5:20). From a biblical standpoint: - God alone has the authority to give and take life (Deuteronomy 32:39). - He commands, “You shall not murder” (Exodus 20:13). - The civil magistrate’s duty is to protect the innocent, not authorize their destruction (Romans 13:3–4). Thus, abortion is not medicine; it is rebellion against the Creator and injustice against one’s smallest neighbor. Real healthcare would treat both the mother and the child as patients worthy of protection and care. It would seek to preserve both lives, not pit them against each other. As abolitionists, we must also expose how the “healthcare” claim functions strategically—it reframes moral evil as medical necessity to numb consciences and legalize murder. Christians must reject that framing entirely, not debate it on its own terms. The issue is not about access to medical services; it is about obedience to God’s law and justice for the innocent ."

    "content": "That question goes right to the heart of the matter, and it’s one that deserves a clear and biblical answer. First, even if every aborted child were immediately received into the presence of Christ—which many Reformed Baptists and other Protestants believe is indeed the case—that would not make abortion any less evil. Scripture is clear that we are never permitted to do evil that good may come (Romans 3:8). The fact that God can redeem evil actions and bring good from them does not justify committing those actions. God’s sovereignty never excuses man’s sin. Abortion is murder—the intentional killing of an innocent human being. Each child in the womb is a living soul made by God (Psalm 139:13–16; Jeremiah 1:5). The moral question, therefore, is not what happens to the baby afterward , but what man has done before God in shedding innocent blood. We might also ask: would it be righteous for us to kill all infants, or all Christians, because we believe they would go to Heaven? Of course not. That would be rebellion against God’s law. Abortion is not a mercy; it is the unjust destruction of a neighbor whom we are commanded to love (Matthew 22:39). In addition, God uses even the short lives of those little ones to testify to His justice and grace. Their deaths are not meaningless, but their murderers will be held accountable unless they repent and trust in Christ. God commands rulers to protect innocent life, not to destroy it (Romans 13:3–4). The abolitionist stance is simply obedience to that command—calling both individuals and nations to repent immediately and abolish abortion entirely , not regulate or excuse it."

    "content": "Biblical Answer: In the book of Job, the patriarch exclaims that he was a living being \"from my mother's womb\" (Job 3:11). Job says, \"why did I not die at birth?\", indicating he was alive in the womb before he was born. Additionally, in the Gospel of Luke, we read that when Mary visited Elizabeth, the unborn John the Baptist leaped in her womb upon hearing Mary's greeting (Luke 1:41). These passages indicate that life--and personhood--are present even while in the womb. Scientific Answer: According to the position paper by the American College of Pediatricians titled <a href=\"https://acpeds.org/when-human-life-begins/\" target=\" blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" When Human Life Begins </a , \"research in embryology and related biological sciences overwhelmingly indicates that human life begins at conception (fertilization).\" At fertilization the zygote is a living, genetically distinct human organism who will grow and develop through every subsequent stage of life."
