    <h1>Scripture Hover Test</h1>
    <p>
      This page is used to verify the Bible reference parser. Consider how Romans 8:1 declares that
      there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, and how Psalm 23:1-3 comforts
      weary saints. Even brief exhortations such as 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 and Jude 1:24 remind us of
      the joyful perseverance and preservation granted to believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can also reference smaller works like Obadiah 1:3 or 3 John 4 without specifying a chapter.
      Longer quotations such as Isaiah 53:4â€”6 show how the Suffering Servant carries our sorrows,
      while Revelation 21:1-4 points forward to the consummation of all things in Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this tool works reliably, it can be applied to the full Q&amp;A library so that readers can
      quickly inspect passages like John 3:16, 3John 8 or Genesis 1:27 as they study abolitionist reasoning.
