    <h1>About abolition.ing</h1>
<p>  
Abolition.ing exists to serve Christ’s church, equipping families and neighbors to see abortion rightly—as the unjust taking of innocent human life—and to act accordingly. Our purpose is not to repeat political slogans or echo the shifting rhetoric of worldly movements, but to declare the unchanging truth of God’s Word: that every child, from conception, is a person deserving of full protection under the law. Here, you will find biblical and historical answers that call Christians to reject compromise and to pursue the total and immediate abolition of abortion in our generation, as an act of obedience to King Jesus.

<p>  
Because abolition is not a mere political cause but a command of justice rooted in the gospel, Abolition.ing directs believers to faithful churches and ministries laboring for righteousness without partiality. We seek to equip pastors, legislators, educators, and ordinary saints with resources that unite conviction with compassion—proclaiming truth in love, yet refusing to excuse or regulate evil. Through a fun question and answer format, visitors can learn how to engage the culture, confront unjust laws, and bear witness to the Lord who demands that His people “rescue those being taken away to death” (Proverbs 24:11).

<p>  
Abolition.ing is maintained by followers of Christ who desire to see His bride purified and His justice established. We welcome correction and contribution that strengthen the clarity and courage of the church’s witness. All resources are freely offered so that every believer may study, share, and act upon the truth. Our prayer is that these pages would stir repentance where apathy has reigned, embolden redemptive action among God’s people, and renew grateful confidence in the gospel—the power of God that compels us to defend the preborn and to proclaim Christ as Lord over life, law, and love.
