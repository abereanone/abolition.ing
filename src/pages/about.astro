    <h1>About {siteName}</h1>
    <p>
      {siteName} exists to serve all of humanity so that we might see abortion rightly and act
      accordingly. Our purpose is not to repeat political slogans or echo the shifting rhetoric of
      worldly movements, but to declare the unchanging truth of God's Word: every child, from conception,
      is a human being that deserves full protection under the law. Here you will find biblical and
      historical answers that call Christians to reject compromise and to pursue the total and immediate
      abolition of abortion in our generation as an act of obedience to King Jesus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because abolition is not a mere political cause but a command of justice rooted in the gospel,
      {siteName} directs believers to faithful churches and ministries that labor for righteousness without
      partiality. We seek to equip pastors, legislators, educators, and ordinary saints with resources that
      unite conviction with compassion, proclaiming truth in love yet refusing to excuse or regulate evil.
      Through a fun question and answer format, visitors can learn how to engage the culture, confront unjust
      laws, and bear witness to the Lord who demands that His people "rescue those being taken away to death"
      (Proverbs 24:11).
    </p>

    <p>
      {siteName} is maintained by followers of Christ who desire to see His bride purified and His justice
      established. We welcome correction and contribution that strengthen the clarity and courage of the
      church's witness. All resources are freely offered so that every believer may study, share, and act
      upon the truth. Our prayer is that these pages would stir repentance where apathy has reigned, embolden
      redemptive action among God's people, and renew grateful confidence in the gospel--the power of God
      that compels us to defend the preborn and to proclaim Christ as Lord over life, law, and love.
