    <h1>About abolition.ing</h1>
    <p>
      Abolition.ing exists to serve churches, families, and civic neighbors who desire clarity on the
      call to abolish abortion in our generation. Rather than echoing headlines or partisan slogans,
      the site gathers historic Christian teaching, current strategy insights, and on the ground
      testimonies into plain language answers. Each question is crafted to name the moral, biblical,
      and practical stakes of protecting preborn lives while honoring the dignity of mothers, fathers,
      and communities affected by abortion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because abolition is a holistic mandate, the project points visitors toward churches and
      ministries laboring for justice with equal measures of conviction and compassion. You will find
      curated resources to equip sidewalk counselors, legislators, educators, and everyday believers
      who want to speak truthfully without losing tenderness. The author profiles highlight trusted
      voices who contribute answers, sermons, and study tools, while the category pages make it simple
      to explore moral, biblical, scientific, and civic arguments in an ordered way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abolition.ing is maintained by believers committed to transparent sourcing and gentle
      persuasion. We invite feedback, corrections, and additional testimonies that can sharpen the
      witness of the church. As questions and answers grow, the site will remain freely accessible so
      any neighbor can study, share, and act. Our prayer is that these pages embolden redemptive
      action, encourage repentance where needed, and stir grateful confidence in the gospel that
      compels us to love preborn image bearers.
