That’s a thoughtful and important question, because it touches on how Christian couples should think about marriage, fruitfulness, and stewardship of life before God.

Scripture never commands every married couple to conceive as quickly or as frequently as biologically possible, but it **does** clearly present children as a *blessing* and fruitfulness as the normal design of marriage (Genesis 1:28; Psalm 127:3–5). The 1689 London Baptist Confession (Chapter 25, *Of Marriage*) reflects this: marriage is “for the mutual help of husband and wife,” and for the “increase of mankind with a legitimate issue.” In other words, childbearing is one of marriage’s natural and God-ordained purposes.

So, can a couple delay pregnancy through natural means such as observing fertility cycles? Possibly—but only if their motives and circumstances are **righteous and temporary**, not selfish or worldly. For example, there may be legitimate reasons of health, recovery after childbirth, or extraordinary hardship that call for delaying conception for a season. Yet these decisions must always be made:

1. **With a heart of submission to God’s sovereignty over life and wombs** (Genesis 30:22; Psalm 113:9).
2. **With openness to His blessing of children**, not a posture of rejecting them.
3. **In prayer and unity** between husband and wife (1 Corinthians 7:5).

Natural family planning (NFP) differs morally from contraception that destroys or blocks life, because it does not alter the created function of sex or destroy an embryo after conception. But even with NFP, the moral question is the *heart posture*: is the couple trusting God and seeking His glory, or trying to control life for convenience or fear?

In short:

* Scripture **does not forbid** careful timing or spacing of children through natural observation, when done with humility and right motives.
* Scripture **does forbid** any attempt to prevent or end life through sinful means, or to reject the blessing of children out of selfishness.
