Bear burdens practically (Galatians 6:2): meals, transport, childcare, housing, medical costs. Pair families with deacons for ongoing care. Pray, visit, and encourage husbands to lead. Partner with ethical physicians who refuse abortion. Remind mothers of God’s nearness (Isaiah 41:10) and the church’s commitment to stand with them.
