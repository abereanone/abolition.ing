Heartbeat bills can imply that life is protectable only after detection, leaving earlier children unprotected and often exempting mothers. God forbids partiality in justice (Deuteronomy 1:17); life begins at conception. Christians should press for abolition that bans all abortion with equal justice, not incremental measures that regulate murder.
