Both state and federal spheres are accountable to God. Pursue abolition wherever jurisdiction allows: press your state to enact equal protection now, and urge federal authorities to uphold justice nationally. Reject delay framed as strategy; partiality is sin. We labor on all fronts, trusting Christ to honor faithfulness more than political calculus.
