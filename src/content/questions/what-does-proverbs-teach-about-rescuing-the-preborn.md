Proverbs 24:11-12 commands us to rescue those being taken away to death. God sees when we shrink back. Wisdom demands active intervention—pleading, legislating justly, offering support, and risking comfort to save neighbors. To ignore the preborn is folly; to act is obedience flowing from fear of the Lord.
