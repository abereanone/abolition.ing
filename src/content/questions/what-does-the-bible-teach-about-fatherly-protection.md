Fathers are charged to protect and provide (Ephesians 6:4; 1 Timothy 5:8). Scripture calls men to defend the weak (Psalm 82:3) and to love their wives as Christ loves the church (Ephesians 5:25). Allowing abortion betrays both mother and child; godly fathers guard life, lead sacrificially, and refuse cowardice.
