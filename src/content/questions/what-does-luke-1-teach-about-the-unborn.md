Luke 1:41 shows unborn John the Baptist leaping for joy at unborn Jesus. This is real worship in the womb. The scripture treats these humans as more than just tissue, John the Baptist's soul is capable of the worship of God, and Jesus is known by his cousin as the person He Is, the Great I Am.

The unborn are people whose lives must be protected. God is already at work in the smallest of humans!
