Graphic images can awaken the conscience to abortion’s cruelty, but they can also harden or retraumatize. Use them, if at all, with pastoral care, lawful conduct, and readiness to offer the gospel and tangible help. Whatever you do, let love for neighbor and reverence for God govern your methods (1 Corinthians 16:14).
