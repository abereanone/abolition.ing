The church must speak clearly and boldly. Silence in the face of evil is sin (Proverbs 24:11–12).

Pastors should preach the truth about abortion and call for repentance (2 Timothy 4:2). Believers should act to defend the preborn, support mothers, and confront unjust laws.

The church’s mission is not politics but obedience. Yet obedience includes calling nations to righteousness (Matthew 28:19–20). Revival begins when the people of God repent and stand for justice.
