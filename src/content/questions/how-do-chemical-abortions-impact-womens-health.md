Chemical abortions (mifepristone/misoprostol) starve and expel a child. Risks include hemorrhage, infection, retained tissue, undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy, and trauma from seeing the child's body. Scripture warns against shedding innocent blood (Proverbs 1:16) and calling evil good (Isaiah 5:20). They harm both mother and child.
