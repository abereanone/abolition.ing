Exodus 21:22-25 treats harm to the unborn with the same lex talionis standard applied to all persons. If there is injury, the penalty is life for life, eye for eye. The passage affirms personhood in the womb and God’s demand for equal justice. It undercuts any claim that Scripture permits lesser protections for the preborn.
