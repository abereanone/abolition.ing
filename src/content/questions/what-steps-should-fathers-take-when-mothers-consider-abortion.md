Repent of passivity; lovingly plead for the child's life; provide tangible support and protection; involve church shepherds; seek just legal recourse if needed. Fathers must reflect Christ's sacrificial headship (Ephesians 5:25) and obey Proverbs 24:11 by intervening to rescue. Pray, stand firm, and offer ongoing care for mother and baby.
