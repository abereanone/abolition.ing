Churches must respond with both truth and restoration. Pursue Matthew 18: private confrontation, then witnesses, then the church if unrepentant. Hold out Christ’s full pardon to the penitent and walk with them through grief and restitution. Discipline aims at recovery, not shame, and protects the flock from treating murder lightly.
