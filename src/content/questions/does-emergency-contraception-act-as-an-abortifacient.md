Many “emergency” pills may thin the uterine lining and prevent implantation. If they can expel or starve a conceived child, they are abortifacient and violate “you shall not murder” (Exodus 20:13). Christians should avoid any drug that risks killing an embryo and instead use only means consistent with love of neighbor.
