Birth control is not always sinful, but some forms are. Methods that destroy an embryo or prevent its implantation are wrong because they end a human life (Exodus 20:13).

There is a difference between preventing conception and taking a life that has already begun. Couples must act with knowledge and care, honoring God in every decision (Romans 14:12).

The motive behind using birth control also matters. If the goal is selfishness or fear, that motive is sinful (Psalm 127:3–5). Each couple should seek the Lord in prayer and act with a clear conscience, trusting His wisdom.
