Embryos are image-bearers, not surplus property (Psalm 139:13-16). Rescuing frozen children can be an act of mercy, yet the IVF system that created them is unjust. Couples must proceed with sober conscience, refusing to participate in further creation or destruction of embryos, and seek pastoral wisdom. Whatever is not from faith is sin (Romans 14:23).
