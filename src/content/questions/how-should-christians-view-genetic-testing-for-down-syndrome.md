Genetic screenings must not become a pretext for murder. Every child, including those with Down syndrome, bears God’s image (Genesis 1:27). Testing may inform care, but it must never guide toward abortion. Christians should reject selective killing, offer robust support to families, and celebrate the dignity of every child.
