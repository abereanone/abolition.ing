Lead with Christ's compassion (Matthew 11:28). Name the sin committed against them, call coercers to justice, and name abortion as murder while offering gospel hope. Teach that Christ's blood cleanses all sin (1 John 1:9). Provide gentle discipleship, trauma-aware care, lament, and a path to serve others in redemption.
