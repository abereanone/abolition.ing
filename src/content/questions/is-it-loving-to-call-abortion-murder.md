Yes. Love tells the truth, even when it’s hard (Ephesians 4:15). To call abortion anything less than murder is to lie and allow sin to continue.

Scripture commands us to expose the works of darkness (Ephesians 5:11). True love warns of danger and points to hope in Christ.

Speaking truth about abortion is not hatred—it is compassion for both mother and child. Only when sin is seen for what it is can grace be understood for what it offers.
