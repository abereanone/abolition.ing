Churches must lead with the gospel, assuring repentant parents that Christ’s blood truly cleanses every sin. Pair that hope with patient discipleship, trauma-informed counseling, and intergenerational fellowship that refuses to stigmatize the broken. As the body bears their burdens, the repentant can heal, testify, and join the mission to protect other families.
