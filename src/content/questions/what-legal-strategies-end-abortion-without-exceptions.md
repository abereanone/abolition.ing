Pass abolition bills that establish equal protection from conception, criminalize all intentional killing of preborn children, and remove immunity that treats mothers or abortionists differently. Reject regulatory schemes that permit some murders (gestational limits, exceptions). Magistrates must fear God, not man (2 Samuel 23:3), and uphold justice consistently.
