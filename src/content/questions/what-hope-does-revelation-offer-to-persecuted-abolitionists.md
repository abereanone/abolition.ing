Revelation shows the Lamb reigning and the martyrs vindicated. Those who resist the dragon’s war on children share in Christ’s sufferings but also in His victory. Persevering witnesses conquer by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony (Revelation 12:11). Endurance is worth it; Jesus will wipe every tear.
