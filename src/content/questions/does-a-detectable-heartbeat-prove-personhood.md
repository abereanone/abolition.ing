Heartbeat detection simply reveals what God made at conception: a human person (Psalm 139:13–16). Personhood does not begin with a detectable pulse; life begins when God knits the child. Heartbeat laws can imply lesser protection before detection. Justice must guard the preborn from conception, without exceptions.
