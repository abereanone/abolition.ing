The pro-life movement seeks to regulate abortion. Abolition calls for it to end immediately and completely.

Pro-life laws often allow abortion in some cases or only after certain stages. Abolition rejects partial measures and demands equal justice for all preborn children (Proverbs 17:15; Isaiah 1:16–17).

Scripture teaches that murder should not be regulated but punished (Romans 13:3–4). Abolition stands on that truth. The goal is not fewer abortions—it is no abortions, because every life is precious to God.
