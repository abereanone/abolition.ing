Men who participated in abortion need conviction, repentance, and restoration. Churches must preach law and gospel, call sin what it is, and offer Christ's full forgiveness (Isaiah 1:18). Assign mature mentors, require restitution where possible, and integrate them into accountable fellowship and service. Grace trains us to holiness (Titus 2:11-12).
