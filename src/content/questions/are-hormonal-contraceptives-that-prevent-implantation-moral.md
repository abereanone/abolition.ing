Anything that prevents implantation ends a newly conceived child. Scripture honors the fruit of the womb as God’s heritage (Psalm 127:3) and forbids the shedding of innocent blood (Exodus 20:13). Methods that function by killing an embryo violate God’s law and love of neighbor; Christians should abstain.
