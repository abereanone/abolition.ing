Approach physicians with truth and sobriety: abortion is the shedding of innocent blood (Exodus 20:13; Proverbs 6:17). Appeal to their conscience and professional oath to heal, not kill. Offer the gospel of Christ who forgives every repentant sinner (1 John 1:9), and urge them to cease, confess, and make restitution. Partner with ethical providers to show there is a faithful way to practice medicine.
