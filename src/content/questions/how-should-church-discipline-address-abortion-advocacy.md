Christ has given the keys to the church to guard the gospel and the flock (Matthew 18; 1 Corinthians 5). If a member advocates for abortion, elders must warn, instruct, and call to repentance. Persisting in promoting murder hardens the conscience and dishonors Christ; loving discipline, up to excommunication if unrepentant, aims to restore the sinner and protect the assembly.
