Rape is evil, and those who commit it must face justice (Deuteronomy 22:25–27). But abortion does not bring justice. It takes the life of an innocent child.

The child is not guilty of the father’s crime (Ezekiel 18:20). Killing that child only adds one sin to another. Christians must show compassion to women who suffer and defend the life of every child.

The gospel offers healing and hope. God brings redemption even in tragedy (Romans 8:28). Our response should be mercy, justice, and truth.
