Abortion is wrong because it is the taking of innocent human life. God commands, “You shall not murder” (Exodus 20:13). A child in the womb is a living human being from conception (Psalm 139:13–16; Luke 1:41). Ending that life is a direct violation of God’s law.

Abortion is not healthcare; it is violence against the most defenseless among us. God hates hands that shed innocent blood (Proverbs 6:16–17).

Christians must call abortion what it is—murder—and call people to repentance and faith in Christ, who alone can forgive sin and change hearts (1 John 1:9).
