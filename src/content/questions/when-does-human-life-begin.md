### Biblical Answer:
In the book of Job, the patriarch exclaims that he was a living being "from my mother's womb" (Job 3:11). Job says, "why did I not die at birth?", indicating he was alive in the womb before he was born. Additionally, in the Gospel of Luke, we read that when Mary visited Elizabeth, the unborn John the Baptist leaped in her womb upon hearing Mary's greeting (Luke 1:41). These passages indicate that life--and personhood--are present even while in the womb.

### Scientific Answer:
According to the position paper by the American College of Pediatricians titled <a href="https://acpeds.org/when-human-life-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  When Human Life Begins
</a>, "research in embryology and related biological sciences overwhelmingly indicates that human life begins at conception (fertilization)." At fertilization the zygote is a living, genetically distinct human organism who will grow and develop through every subsequent stage of life.
