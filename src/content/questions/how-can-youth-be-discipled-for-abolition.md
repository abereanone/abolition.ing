Disciple teenagers with Scripture’s view of life, sin, and the cross. Walk through Proverbs 24:11-12, Psalm 139, and Luke 1 so they see God’s heart. Train them in prayer, mercy, and courage, paired with practical service alongside mature believers. Keep the gospel central so zeal flows from love, not mere outrage.
