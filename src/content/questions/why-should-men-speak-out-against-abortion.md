Men are called to protect, lead, and defend the innocent (Proverbs 24:11–12; Micah 6:8). Silence in the face of injustice is cowardice (James 4:17). Abortion persists partly because men have abdicated their duty to act as righteous leaders and defenders. God holds men accountable to do justice and walk uprightly — not only as fathers and husbands, but also as citizens (Ezekiel 22:30; 1 Corinthians 16:13).

Speaking out is not intrusion; it is obedience to God’s command to rescue those being led to death (Proverbs 31:8–9).
