The early church uniformly condemned abortion. The Didache called it murder; Athanasius, Tertullian, and Basil spoke likewise. Believers rescued exposed infants and opposed child-killing as a fruit of the gospel ethic. Historic Christianity aligns with Scripture: the church must protect preborn children and oppose this bloodshed.
