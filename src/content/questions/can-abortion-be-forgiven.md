Yes. Christ's atonement is sufficient for every sin of His people, including abortion. Abortion is a grave sin, but Christ’s grace is greater (1 John 1:7–9).

Anyone who has participated in abortion—whether through the act itself or by supporting it—can be forgiven if they repent and believe in Jesus Christ. His blood cleanses from all sin.

Forgiveness does not erase what was done, but it removes guilt before God. The church must speak both truth and hope: abortion is murder, and Christ forgives murderers who turn to Him (Isaiah 1:18; Romans 8:1).
