Yes. Science shows that a new human life begins at conception. From that moment, the embryo has its own DNA and grows by its own internal direction.

This truth supports what Scripture has always said—that human life begins in the womb (Psalm 139:13–16; Jeremiah 1:5).

Science cannot define morality, but it can confirm facts. Abortion destroys a living human being. Christians should use truth from both Scripture and science to defend life.
