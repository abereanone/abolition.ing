Families can choose hospitality ahead of time: set aside budget, bedrooms, meals, and time to help mothers in crisis (Galatians 6:2). Coordinate with your elders so care is shepherded, not solo. Practice saying, "We will stand with you and your child," then back it with childcare, transportation, and advocacy. Trust the Lord who provides when His people open their homes (1 Peter 4:9).
