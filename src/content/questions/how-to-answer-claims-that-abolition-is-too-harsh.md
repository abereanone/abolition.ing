God forbids partiality in justice (Deuteronomy 1:17). Abolition is not harsh; it is consistent love for every image-bearer and equal weights and measures. Softening justice for the preborn denies their humanity. We pair truthful law with rich mercy for mothers and fathers, holding out Christ who saves sinners and upholds righteousness.
