If an insurance plan funds abortion, believers must not participate in the shedding of innocent blood (Romans 1:32). Seek alternatives: opt-out riders, employer negotiations, health-share ministries, or conscience accommodations. If constrained, protest in writing, pursue change, and consider costly obedience for a clear conscience (Acts 5:29). Trust the Lord to provide as you refuse to finance murder.
