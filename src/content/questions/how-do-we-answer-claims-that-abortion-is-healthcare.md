We answer that claim by going back to the truth about what abortion *is*. Scripture and reason both reveal that abortion is **the intentional killing of an innocent human being**. No act that deliberately takes innocent human life can rightly be called “healthcare.”

Healthcare, properly defined, is the practice of **preserving and restoring health**. It aims to protect life, heal the sick, and care for the weak. Abortion, by contrast, **ends** the life of one human being and often harms the body and soul of another. To call it “healthcare” is to corrupt language in order to justify evil—much like calling slavery “property management” or genocide “population control.” It is a lie that disguises murder as mercy (Isaiah 5:20).

From a biblical standpoint:

- God alone has the authority to give and take life (Deuteronomy 32:39).
- He commands, *“You shall not murder”* (Exodus 20:13).
- The civil magistrate’s duty is to protect the innocent, not authorize their destruction (Romans 13:3–4).

Thus, abortion is not medicine; it is rebellion against the Creator and injustice against one’s smallest neighbor. Real healthcare would treat both the mother and the child as patients worthy of protection and care. It would seek to *preserve* both lives, not pit them against each other.

As abolitionists, we must also expose how the “healthcare” claim functions strategically—it reframes moral evil as medical necessity to numb consciences and legalize murder. Christians must reject that framing entirely, not debate it on its own terms. The issue is not about access to medical services; it is about **obedience to God’s law and justice for the innocent**.
