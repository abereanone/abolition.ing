Medical evidence clearly distinguishes life-saving care for ectopic pregnancies from abortion. An **ectopic pregnancy** occurs when a human embryo implants outside the uterus—most often in a fallopian tube—where it cannot survive and where rupture endangers the mother’s life. Treatment involves removing the embryo or the damaged tissue (via salpingectomy, salpingostomy, or methotrexate), which is **not** the same as intentionally killing a child in the womb. Abortion deliberately ends a living **intrauterine** pregnancy; ectopic care treats a **pathological, nonviable** implantation to preserve the mother’s life. The intent, procedure, and moral nature differ completely.
