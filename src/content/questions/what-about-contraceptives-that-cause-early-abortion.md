Some contraceptives can cause early abortion by preventing an embryo from implanting or surviving. Such methods destroy a human life and are morally wrong (Exodus 20:13).

Christians must research and choose methods that do not harm life after conception. God calls us to act with knowledge and integrity (Proverbs 2:6–9).

Convenience cannot justify wrongdoing. Believers must honor God even in private choices, trusting Him with every part of life.
