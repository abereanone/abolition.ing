Gestational surrogacy—where an embryo is created through in-vitro fertilization and implanted into a woman who carries the child for someone else—is **not consistent with biblical teaching on motherhood, family, or the sanctity of human life**.

### 1. **Motherhood in Scripture**

Biblically, motherhood is inseparable from both **biological connection** and **covenantal relationship**. God designed conception, gestation, and birth as a unified act of procreation within the covenant of marriage. The woman who conceives and bears a child is the child’s mother (Genesis 3:16; Luke 1:31). Scripture never divides these roles between different women, and doing so introduces confusion and harm to the natural order God established.

### 2. **Marriage Covenant and Procreation**

The 1689 London Baptist Confession (Chapter 25, §2) states that marriage was ordained “for the mutual help of husband and wife, for the increase of mankind with a legitimate issue, and for preventing of uncleanness.”
Surrogacy severs procreation from that covenantal union, often involving:

* **Third-party participation** (another woman’s womb, often another man’s or woman’s gametes),
* **Laboratory manipulation of embryos**, and
* **Contractual ownership** of children.

This undermines the exclusive one-flesh relationship of marriage (Genesis 2:24) and treats children as products rather than gifts of God (Psalm 127:3).

### 3. **Human Life and Ethical Concerns**

Surrogacy is frequently linked with IVF practices that involve the creation and destruction of multiple human embryos—each a distinct image-bearer of God (Genesis 1:27). Even when no embryos are intentionally destroyed, the process still commodifies life, renting the womb and reducing childbearing to a transactional arrangement.

### 4. **Theological Summary**

From a biblical and confessional standpoint:

* Life and family are divine institutions, not commercial contracts.
* A child is never a right to be claimed but a gift to be received.
* Dividing motherhood violates the unity of body, soul, and covenant that God ordains in procreation.

Gestational surrogacy, therefore, **contradicts biblical teaching** by redefining motherhood, undermining the covenant of marriage, and often participating in practices that devalue human life.
