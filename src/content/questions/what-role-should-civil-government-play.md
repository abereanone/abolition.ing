Civil government exists to punish evil and protect the innocent (Romans 13:3–4). Allowing abortion is rebellion against God’s authority.

Rulers are God’s servants for good. When they approve of killing, they fail their duty and bring judgment on the nation (Psalm 2:10–12).

The government must not regulate murder but abolish it completely. Equal protection for every person—born and preborn—is the demand of justice. Christians should urge their leaders to obey God and defend life.
