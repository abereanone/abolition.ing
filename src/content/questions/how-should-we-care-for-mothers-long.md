# Extended Explanation: Caring for Mothers

A robust abolitionist response includes:

- **Presence**: Offer prayer, discipleship, and accountability through a local church body.

- **Provision**: Connect families with housing, medical care, and employment resources.

- **Protection**: Advocate for laws that defend both mother and child.

- **Proclamation**: Share the gospel that calls all of us to repentance and offers rest in Christ. Matthew 28:19

When we walk with mothers, meeting needs while declaring truth, we display the justice and mercy of Christ.
