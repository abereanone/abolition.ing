Ask: Does it protect every child from conception without exception? Does it outlaw all abortion as murder and require equal justice (Proverbs 24:11–12; Romans 13:3–4)? Bills that regulate murder (gestational limits, exceptions, immunity for mothers who self-abort) compromise God’s law. Support abolition bills that establish equal protection.
