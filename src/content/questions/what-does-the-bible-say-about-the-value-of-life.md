The Bible teaches that life is a gift from God (Acts 17:25). He alone gives and takes life (Deuteronomy 32:39). From conception onward, every person exists by God’s will and for His purposes (Psalm 139:13–16).

To take innocent life is to reject God’s authority and goodness. Murder is condemned throughout Scripture (Genesis 9:6). Christians defend life because it belongs to God, not to us.

Our duty is to protect the weak and to love our neighbor as ourselves (Matthew 22:39).
